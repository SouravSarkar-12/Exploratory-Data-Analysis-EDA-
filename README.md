## OBSERVATIONS FOR EACH VISUAL

### Include simple insights after each plot like:
    A. Pairplot: 
            # Survival is strongly related to Pclass — 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
            # Age and survival show a slight pattern.
            # Fare correlates with both Pclass and survival — higher fares (1st class) had better chances.
            # Traveling alone (SibSp = 0, Parch = 0) was more common, but having family, there's a slight advatage for survival.
            # Data shows class and social status were critical factors in survival outcomes.
    B. Heatmap: 
            # The red ones shows us that the attributes have positve correlation and blue ones have negative correlation. The whitish tone are the neutrals.
            # So from the fig., Pclass and Fare have negative high-correlation.      
    C. Histogram: Parch is right-skewed.
    D. Boxplot: Outliers found in Fare.
    E. Scatterplot: 
            # Most passengers (Parch = 0) traveled without parents or children, making it the most frequent group.
            # Passengers with Parch ≥ 3 are rare and generally paid lower fares, possibly due to group discounts or lower-class accommodation.
            # There is no strong trend or linear correlation between Parch and Fare — other features like Pclass and Cabin likely influence fare more directly.
